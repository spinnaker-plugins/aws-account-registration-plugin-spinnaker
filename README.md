## Spinnaker Plugin for Dynamic Account Registration

### Requirements
1. Must be used with Spinnaker version 1.20 or higher.
2. Must enable [Lambda support](https://kb.armory.io/s/article/AWS-Lambda-Custom-Webhook-Stages).
3. Must enable [ECS support](https://spinnaker.io/setup/install/providers/aws/aws-ecs/#clouddriver-yaml-properties)

### Usage
1. Run `./gradlew releaseBundle` in the root of this project. 
2. The above command will create a zip file, `build/distributions/spinnaker-aws-account-registration*.zip`.
3. Copy the zip file to Clouddriver plugin directory. Defaults to `/opt/clouddriver/plugins`. This directory can be 
specified by the `plugins-root-path` configuration property.
4. Enable the plugin by placing the following in [Clouddriver profile](https://spinnaker.io/reference/halyard/custom/#custom-profiles)


```yaml
spinnaker:
  extensibility:
    plugins-root-path: /opt/clouddriver/plugins
    plugins:
      AWS.AccountRegistration:
        enabled: true
    repositories: {}
    strict-plugin-loading: false
# Available Plugin configuration properties:
accountProvision:
  url: 'http://localhost:8080' # Remote host address. 
  pullFrequencyInMilliSeconds: 10000 # How often this plugin should query the remote host.
  syncAgentFrequencyInMilliSeconds: 10000 # How often agent scheduler should run.
  iamAuth: false # Enable IAM authentication for API Gateway.
  iamAuthRegion: 'us-west-2' # Specify which region API Gateway is deployed. Required if `iamAuth` is enabled.
```

### Known issues
1. When creating lambda functions, on-demand cache update may fail. This seems to be a bug in caching agent in `clouddriver-lambda`.
This is fixed in [this PR](https://github.com/spinnaker/clouddriver/pull/4802). 

### Expected JSON payload
This plugin expects the following JSON payload from the configured remote host, configured with the `url` property.


```json

  "Accounts": [
    {
    "AccountId": "259950518779",
